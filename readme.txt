**********************************************************************************
Minimum requirements

OS Windows 7 or above
.NET 4.5 or higher

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Extract the contents of the incc.zip folder onto your PC.
2. Run INCC6.exe
3. A "bare" SQLite database has been provided for your use. It is named "incc6.sqlite".
   SQL Server support is available.
   INCC6.exe.Config contains the connection details, manually configure following the notes
   and example in the file. Create the SQL Server database using the create_INCC6_sqlserver.sql
   script.
4. If for any reason the INCC6 Beta release stops working, you may opt to restore the
   default SQLite database by running the "reset.bat" batch file or
   by copying Default.sqlite over INCC6.sqlite. For SQL Server run the drop_INCC6_sqlserver.sql
   script followed by create_INCC6_sqlserver.sql.

**********************************************************************************

These are the basic files installed with INCC6.

All these files must reside in the same folder, but for the database.

KNOWN ISSUES:

Many dialogs and features from INCC 5.* are not fully implemented e.g.
   Collar acquire and Poison Rod details, Holdup and glovebox features,
   Active/Passive paired measurements, Rad Review controlled import,
   truncated multiplicity and some multiplicity analyses are incomplete,
   some Add-a-src processing, miscellaneous little-used features
   and integrated help.

This is beta release software; issues and missing features are known to exist.

PTR-32 support:

A USB device driver from Digilent is required for PTR-32 connectivity.
If you have installed the PTR-32 vendor's software, then the device driver is already present.
If not, install the PTR-32 vendors software, or obtain the drivers directly.

In the absence of the PTR-32 vendor's software, this package supports the PTR-32:
Digilent Adept 2.3, with DpcUtils 2.1

http://www.digilentinc.com/Data/Products/adept/DigilentAdept_v2-3-0.exe

Also available directly from the vendor, or elsewhere, is Diligent Adept 2.10.2, with DpcUtils 2.7.2.


Packages for older Windows systems (Vista, XP) are found at these links:
